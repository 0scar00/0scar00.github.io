       My name is Oscar Aquino, a college freshmen attending the University of Rhode Island, and I major in Computer Science.<br>
       I was born in Guatemala, and moved to Rhode Island at the age of 10. I like staying active by exercising and playing<br>
       sports. I like to play basketball at the park with my friends, and I wrestled for the wrestling team during High SChool.<br>
       Particulary I enjoy calisthenics when it comes to exercise which is basically Body-weight training. A fun fact about<br>
       is that I am Christian.
