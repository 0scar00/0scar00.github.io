       My name is Oscar Aquino, a college freshmen attending the University of Rhode Island, and I major in Computer Science. I was born in Guatemala, <br>
       and moved to Rhode Island at the age of 10. I like staying active by exercising and playing sports. I like to play basketball at the park with my <br>
       friends, and I wrestled for the wrestling team during High SChool. Particulary I enjoy calisthenics when it comes to exercise which is basically<br>
       Body-weight training. I fun fact about myself is that I am Christian.
